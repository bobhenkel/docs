# Flatcar Container Linux developer SDK guide

These are the instructions for building Flatcar Container Linux itself. By the end of the guide you will build a developer image that you can run under KVM and have tools for making changes to the code.

Flatcar Container Linux is an open source project. All of the source for Flatcar Container Linux is available on [github][github-flatcar]. If you find issues with these docs or the code please send a pull request.

Direct questions and suggestions to the [IRC channel][irc] or [mailing list][flatcar-dev].

## Getting started

Let's get set up with an SDK chroot and build a bootable image of Flatcar Container Linux. The SDK chroot has a full toolchain and isolates the build process from quirks and differences between host OSes. The SDK must be run on an x86-64 Linux machine, the distro should not matter (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc).

### Prerequisites

System requirements to get started:

* curl
* git
* bzip2
* gpg
* sudo

You also need a proper git setup:

```sh
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

**NOTE**: Do the git configuration as a normal user and not with sudo.

### Using Cork

The `cork` utility, included in the Flatcar Container Linux [mantle](https://github.com/flatcar-linux/mantle) project, is used to create and work with an SDK chroot.

First, download the cork utility and verify it with the signature:

```sh
curl -L -o cork https://github.com/flatcar-linux/mantle/releases/download/v0.14.0/cork-0.14.0-amd64
curl -L -o cork.sig https://github.com/flatcar-linux/mantle/releases/download/v0.14.0/cork-0.14.0-amd64.sig
gpg --receive-keys 84C8E771C0DF83DFBFCAAAF03ADA89DEC2507883
gpg --verify cork.sig cork
```

The `gpg --verify` command should output something like this:

```
gpg: Signature made Mon 07 Jan 2019 14:51:50 CET
gpg:                using RSA key 84C8E771C0DF83DFBFCAAAF03ADA89DEC2507883
gpg: Good signature from "Flatcar Application Signing Key <buildbot@flatcar-linux.org>" [unknown]
Primary key fingerprint: C1C0 B82A 2F75 90B2 E369  822B E52F 0DB3 9145 3C45
     Subkey fingerprint: 84C8 E771 C0DF 83DF BFCA  AAF0 3ADA 89DE C250 7883
```

Then proceed with the installation of the cork binary to a location on your path:

```sh
chmod +x cork
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
mv cork ~/.local/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin
```

You may want to add the `PATH` export to your shell profile (e.g. `.bashrc`).


Next, use the cork utility to create a project directory. This will hold all of your git repos and the SDK chroot. A few gigabytes of space will be necessary.

```sh
mkdir flatcar-sdk
cd flatcar-sdk
cork create # This will request root permisions via sudo
cork enter # This will request root permisions via sudo
```

By default `cork create` will download the latest SDK used for the Stable release which can be changed with `--sdk-version x.y.z`.
You can also change the SDK release later.

A manifest defines which source code branches are checked out. The default manifest uses the development branches for the Stable channel.
If you want to patch a specific release, you can pass `--manifest-branch flatcar-build-x.y.z` and if you want to work on a channel other
than Stable you can pass `--manifest-name CHANNEL-master.xml`. You can also change the branches later with git.

Verify you are in the SDK chroot:

```
$ grep NAME /etc/os-release
NAME="Flatcar Container Linux by Kinvolk"
```
To leave the SDK chroot, simply run `exit`.

To use the SDK chroot in the future, run `cork enter` from the above directory.

### Building an image

#### Set up the chroot

When entering the SDK you are in the `~/trunk/src/scripts` repository which can be seen as the build system.
It is one of the three repositories that define a Flatcar build. The other two are the `~/trunk/src/third_party/portage-stable`
and the `~/trunk/src/third_party/coreos-overlay` repository. These contain Gentoo package build files. The `portage-stable` repository
hosts build files for upstream Gentoo packages and the `coreos-overlay` repository contains additional and patched packages.
You have to check out the right combination of branches if you don't use the default. For example, checking out a feature branch
based on the `flatcar-master-alpha` branch of `coreos-overlay` means that `portage-stable` and `scripts` also need to point
to `flatcar-master-alpha` (or a feature branch based on it).
Any other repositories under `third_party/` are managed by commit references and you should not alter them.

The chroot you entered has the SDK packages installed. The actual image packages are built in a new chroot under `/build/amd64-usr/`
or `/build/arm64-usr/`, called the _board_.
Both chroots use Gentoo's portage to manage the packages (via `sudo emerge` for the SDK and `emerge-BOARD` for the boards).
To reduce the build time it is important that as many binary packages as possible are downloaded from a previous SDK release,
Flatcar release, or nightly build.

To reference the latest nightly builds as source for board packages, use the following command. It has to be rerun if you later want
to switch to a recent nightly version because it only dereferences the nightly of the day when you ran this command, to keep your
build environment reproducible.

```
./set_version --dev-board --board-version amd64-usr/CHANNEL-nightly --no-dev-sdk
# --no-dev-sdk needed because --dev-board implies --dev-sdk
```

To switch to a Flatcar release use the following:

```
./set_version --no-dev-board --board-version x.y.z
# --no-dev-board disables any previous --dev-board setting
```

You should also use this command to switch to a newer SDK release if available.

```
./set_version --no-dev-sdk --sdk-version x.y.z
```

#### Optional: Set a password for console login

After entering the chroot via `cork` for the first time, you can set user `core`'s password:

```sh
./set_shared_user_password.sh
```

This is the password you will use to log into the console of images built and launched with the SDK.

You can also rely on SSH key detection which normally works well when booting the QEMU images.

#### Selecting the architecture to build

`amd64-usr` and `arm64-usr` are the only targets supported by Flatcar.

##### 64 bit AMD: The amd64-usr target

The `--board` option can be set to one of a few known target architectures, or system "boards", to build for a given CPU.

To create a root filesystem for the `amd64-usr` target beneath the directory `/build/amd64-usr/`:

```sh
./setup_board --default --board=amd64-usr
```

#### Compile and link system binaries

Build all of the target binary packages:

```sh
./build_packages
```

You can make sure that a package is rebuilt with your changes by running emerge manually.
For board packages run `emerge-amd64-usr PACKAGE` and for SDK packages run `sudo emerge PACKAGE`
with `PACKAGE` being either `CATEGORY/PACKAGEFOLDER` or just `PACKAGEFOLDER`.

#### Render the Flatcar Container Linux image

Build a production image based on the binary packages built above:

```sh
./build_image
```

After `build_image` completes, it prints commands for converting the raw bin into a bootable virtual machine. Run the `image_to_vm.sh` command.

### Booting

Once you build an image you can launch it with KVM (instructions will print out after `image_to_vm.sh` runs).

If you encounter errors with KVM, verify that virtualization is supported by your CPU by running `egrep '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo`. The `/dev/kvm` directory will be in your host OS when virtualization is enabled in the BIOS.

The `./flatcar_production_qemu.sh` file can be found in the `~/trunk/src/build/images/amd64-usr/latest` directory inside the SDK chroot.

#### Boot Options

After `image_to_vm.sh` completes, run `./flatcar_production_qemu.sh -curses` to launch a graphical interface to log in to the Flatcar Container Linux VM.

You could instead use the `-nographic` option, `./flatcar_production_qemu.sh -nographic`, which gives you the ability to switch from the VM to the QEMU monitor console by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>a</kbd> and then <kbd>c</kbd>. To close the Flatcar Container Linux Guest OS VM, run `sudo systemctl poweroff` inside the VM. 

You could also log in via SSH by running `./flatcar_production_qemu.sh` and then running `ssh core@127.0.0.1 -p 2222` to enter the guest OS. Running without the `-p 2222` option will arise a *ssh: connect to host 127.0.0.1 port 22: Connection refused* or *Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)* warning. Additionally, you can log in via SSH keys or with a different ssh port by running this example `./flatcar_production_qemu.sh -a ~/.ssh/authorized_keys -p 2223 -- -curses`. Refer to the [Booting with QEMU](booting-with-qemu.md#SSH-keys) guide for more information on this usage.

The default login username is `core` and the [password is the one set in the `./set_shared_user_password`](sdk-modifying-flatcar.md#Building-an-image) step of this guide. If you forget your password, you will need to rerun `./set_shared_user_password` and then `./build_image` again.

## Making changes

### git and repo

Flatcar Container Linux is managed by `repo`, a tool built for the Android project that makes managing a large number of git repositories easier. From the repo announcement blog:

> The repo tool uses an XML-based manifest file describing where the upstream
> repositories are, and how to merge them into a single working checkout. repo
> will recurse across all the git subtrees and handle uploads, pulls, and other
> needed items. repo has built-in knowledge of topic branches and makes working
> with them an essential part of the workflow.

(from the [Google Open Source Blog][repo-blog])

You can find the full manual for repo by visiting [android.com - Developing][android-repo-git].

### Updating repo manifests

The repo manifest for Flatcar Container Linux lives in a git repository in
`.repo/manifests`. If you need to update the manifest edit `default.xml`
in this directory.

`repo` uses a branch called 'default' to track the upstream branch you
specify in `repo init`, this defaults to 'origin/master'. Keep this in
mind when making changes, the origin git repository should not have a
'default' branch.

## Building release images

The [production images][prodimages] document is unmaintained and out of date, but contains useful pointers as to how official release images are built.
